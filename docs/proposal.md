This capstone project focuses on building a full-stack data application that uses the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth’s aggregated economic dataset to better understand how different communities participate in the economy. The goal of the project is to turn large amounts of financial and business activity data into simple, clear insights that anyone can interpret. By creating an interactive dashboard, the project will help show patterns in spending, small business health, and overall economic activity, making it easier to see which areas are experiencing growth and which areas may be falling behind. This matters because economic inclusion is a major factor in community stability, access to resources, and long-term opportunity. When certain neighborhoods consistently have lower business activity or weaker spending power, it usually means residents don’t have equal opportunities. This project aims to highlight those gaps in a visual, data-driven way.

The Mastercard Inclusive Growth dataset is a strong choice for this project because it includes anonymized and aggregated information about consumer spending, merchant density, income-related engagement, and small business trends. Unlike other datasets that only show demographics or geography, this dataset reflects actual economic behavior across different neighborhoods. It can show where small businesses are opening or closing, how spending looks from year to year, and whether certain communities are struggling more than others. Because the data is completely anonymized, no personal information is included. This makes it safe to use while still offering powerful insights into economic inequality, financial access, and local business activity. It is also socially impactful because it highlights problems that city leaders, organizations, and community members need to understand if they want to promote fair economic growth.

The technical setup for this project uses FastAPI for the backend, SQLite for data storage, Google Cloud Storage for backups, and Streamlit for the frontend dashboard. FastAPI will handle the API endpoints that provide cleaned and organized data to the dashboard. SQLite is the database used to store normalized versions of the Mastercard data because it is lightweight, simple to use, and works well for projects of this size. Google Cloud Storage will store processed files and dataset backups so the information is safe and accessible. The dashboard will be built in Streamlit, which makes it easy to create charts, maps, and interactive visuals. To keep everything running smoothly, GitHub Actions will be used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), making sure the project can be tested and updated without breaking anything.

The dashboard will include three main sections. The first is an “Inclusive Growth Map,” which will visually show differences in economic activity across regions using a choropleth map. The second is a “Spending Trend Explorer,” which will allow users to look at spending levels over time and compare different areas or types of businesses. The third section is a “Small Business Health Panel,” which will show openings, closures, merchant density, and overall business activity. Users will be able to click filters, adjust time ranges, and explore different types of economic data in an easy and interactive way.

The data management plan includes downloading the Mastercard dataset, cleaning and transforming the values, normalizing metrics like spending and merchant density, storing everything in SQLite, and backing up processed files in Google Cloud Storage. FastAPI will then serve the cleaned information through structured endpoints that the Streamlit dashboard can use.

Ethically, the project must handle economic data carefully. Even though the dataset is anonymized, it is important not to reinforce stereotypes about lower-income neighborhoods. The dashboard will include fair labeling, neutral wording, and clear explanations to avoid misinterpretation. Insights will focus on structural issues rather than blaming individuals.

Although this is a solo project, the work is divided into two tracks. As the Backend/Data Engineer, I will handle ETL processing, FastAPI endpoints, database design, and storage. As the Frontend/Visualization Engineer, I will build the dashboard, create charts, manage filters, and set up CI/CD. Clear objectives for the project include creating at least three working API endpoints, building three interactive dashboard visuals, developing a complete data pipeline with SQLite and GCS, and producing meaningful, easy-to-understand insights about economic inclusion.
