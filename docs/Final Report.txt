# Metro Atlanta Inclusive Growth Dashboard
## Project Overview and Achieved Objectives 
This project focused on designing and implementing a full-stack data application that analyzes inclusive growth across four Metro Atlanta counties—Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, and Clayton—using Mastercard’s Inclusive Growth Score dataset. The main objective was to build a dynamic platform where users can explore economic, community, housing, and infrastructure indicators at both the county and census-tract levels. The application needed to showcase patterns of inequality, highlight regional disparities, and support data-driven conversations around equitable development.
Across Phase 3, all major objectives of the capstone project were successfully met. A fully functioning FastAPI backend was built to manage data retrieval, filtering, and summarization. A structured SQLite database stores hundreds of census-tract observations, and optimized API endpoints allow fast access to both tract-level and county-level insights. On the frontend, a Streamlit dashboard was created with interactive filters, line charts, and an automatically updating data table that enables users to compare trends over time.
The application’s overall architecture reflects industry-standard design: a backend responsible for data logic, a frontend responsible for visualization, automated testing for quality assurance, and CI/CD practices to maintain reliability. By integrating all these components, the project successfully delivers a comprehensive analytical tool that offers insight into urban growth, economic inclusion, and community well-being across Metro Atlanta.

## Technical Implementation 
The backend was built using FastAPI, chosen for its speed, modularity, and automatic documentation via Swagger UI. A dedicated SQLite database was created to store the cleaned Mastercard dataset, and a custom data-loading script (load_data.py) imports and structures the data for efficient querying. Endpoints such as /counties, /years, /summary/county/{name}, and /metrics/county/{name} provide structured access to key indicators while supporting optional filters like year and county.
The frontend uses Streamlit, enabling a responsive dashboard with interactive dropdowns, auto-refreshed charts, and tract-level detail tables. The frontend communicates directly with FastAPI through HTTP requests, resulting in a seamless real-time experience.
Although the original rubric included Google Cloud Storage, this implementation intentionally excluded cloud integration per updated project requirements.
Unit tests were written using Pytest, and code quality was validated with flake8, ensuring readability and reliability across the codebase.

## Ethical Data Practices 
Ethical data handling was a critical component of the project, especially given that inclusive growth metrics directly relate to socioeconomic opportunity, neighborhood conditions, and resource accessibility. While the dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII), ethical considerations were still essential in preventing the misuse or misinterpretation of demographic and community-level insights.
Bias mitigation began during data evaluation. Inclusive Growth Scores are aggregates created from multiple indicators, and census-tract patterns can reflect historical inequities such as redlining, infrastructure disinvestment, or unequal access to transportation and housing. To avoid reinforcing these disparities, the dashboard avoids ranking neighborhoods in a way that could stigmatize communities. Instead, it provides contextual indicators and trend visualizations, positioning the data as a tool for understanding structural patterns rather than assigning judgment.
Privacy considerations were also addressed. Census-tract data inherently aggregates populations, which reduces re-identification risk. Still, the workflow ensured that no external datasets or models were merged in ways that could inadvertently expose sensitive information. Only publicly available, ethically processed data from Mastercard was used.
Transparency was another guiding principle. The dashboard clearly labels each metric and year, ensuring users understand the source and meaning of each value. No algorithmic manipulation or hidden scoring adjustments occur within the application; all values are presented exactly as they appear in the dataset.
Finally, the project acknowledges the importance of fairness in data interpretation. Users are encouraged to view the results as reflections of broad social conditions rather than individual or community-level deficits. This reinforces responsible use of analytics and aligns with principles of equitable data storytelling.

## Challenges and Solutions
Several challenges arose during development. Early issues included missing dependencies, path errors in Codespaces, and misalignment between old Streamlit code and new API endpoints. These were resolved by restructuring directories, rewriting the dashboard to match updated endpoints, and thoroughly testing API calls. Data cleaning was also complex due to inconsistent values and multiple counties within a single CSV; this was addressed through preprocessing scripts and schema validation. Finally, debugging the FastAPI–Streamlit communication required careful logging and endpoint testing. Through iterative fixes and systematic testing, all components were successfully integrated into a stable, production-ready application.
