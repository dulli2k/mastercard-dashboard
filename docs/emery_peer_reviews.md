**Emery Reviewed Proposal**: Equity in Focus: Visualizing Economic Inclusion with the Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score

This proposal clearly explains the purpose of the project and does a good job outlining what the student wants to achieve. The main goal—to help people see where economic opportunities are growing or lacking—is stated in a way that is easy to understand. The objectives, such as building a REST API, creating several visualizations, and completing an ETL pipeline, are specific and realistic for a capstone project. The social impact is also well explained, especially the idea of identifying “investment deserts” and helping organizations better understand which communities need support.
The technical plan is strong and very doable. Using FastAPI, Streamlit, SQLite, and Google Cloud Storage is a good combination for a project of this size. The description of the architecture, ETL pipeline, and CI/CD process shows that the student understands the tools they’ll be using and how everything will work together. The dataset choice is justified well, and the explanation of why the Mastercard Inclusive Growth Score is more useful than standard Census data helps support the project’s purpose.
Ethical concerns are addressed responsibly. The student acknowledges that spending data may not fully represent everyone, especially people who use cash, and they explain how they will avoid making communities look “bad” by focusing on opportunity instead of failure.
One suggestion for improvement is to add more details about how the dashboard will work—for example, what filters users can apply or how they will interact with the charts. Overall, this is a well-written and well-planned proposal.
